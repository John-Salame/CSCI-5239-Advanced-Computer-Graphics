# Homework 6 - Image Processing
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
8-10 hours.
I first tried to get it workin in OpenGL 4, then in OpenGL 2. In both cases, I was unable to get it to render. I got a black screen when trying to draw the quad from the framebuffer texture.
Issue may be with the viewport, projection, or Z-Buffer.  
Eventually, I found out that the issue was me changing the projection matrix in the reshape function and in the "key" function. Once I copied example 8 and put the Projection only in display(), the program worked as intended.

### Description
Use framebuffers and renderbuffers to draw a post-processed scene.

## Interaction
Press M to change the filter mode. The modes are:
* 0: No filter
* 1: Blur
* 2: Prewitt
The mode defaults to 1 (blur).
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Press the nubmer 0 to re-center the object.  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.


### Key bindings
  0          Reset the view
  I          Toggle image post-processing
  p          Change projection mode
  M          Change shader mode
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  ] and [    Zoom in and out
  +/-        Make the blade of grass go closer/further to the origin (originally changed the number of blades of grass in the lawn, but the program is only drawing one blade)
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit
