# Homework 8 - Particle System
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
2 hours

### Description
I added some chaos to the motion of my fireflies. I replaced my individual shader variable per firefly with an array of firefly positions instead. This is much cleaner and more scalable.  
This change will prepare me to add my particle effects. I may have 5-10 particles following the fireflies, spawning in some small sphere around them.  
The grass doesn't look good, but that is not the focus, and I may improve it in a later assignment. My main focus will be on the fireflies and the particles they emit.

### Limitations
I still have not managed to debug the cause of the black screen. The text still shows up. I am not sure which line would render the framebuffer.

## Interaction
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Press the nubmer 0 to re-center the object.  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.  
Press +/- to add or remove patches of grass.  
Press PG UP / PG DOWN or the square brackets to zoom in or out.
