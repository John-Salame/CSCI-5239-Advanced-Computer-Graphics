# Homework 2 - Procedural Textures
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
Approximately 3 to 5 hours.

### Description
Demonstrates the use of shaders for generated textures.
Demonstrates the use of lighting in combination with shaders.
Demonstrates the mixing of colors.

## Interaction
Press M to switch shaders and look at different generated textures.  
Press O to toggle between cube and icosahedron.  
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Press numbers 1 through 4 to move the object to the corners of the screen.  
Press the nubmer 0 to re-center the object.  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.

## Strange Coloration
Icosahedron looks as expected, but the cube has some anomalies.

Due to the SetColor method used by the cube in the CSCI x239 library's lighting.c,
the material properties align with the color of the faces set in the SolidCube function.
Thus, the gl_FrontLightProduct also copies the face color to some varying intensity instead of being white.
When I component-wise multiple the light intensity with the colors generated by my "generated texture" shaders (sawtooth, polka dots, and thorn),
some of the colors disappear and turn black, just like when you shine a red light on a green surface.

This behavior does not exist in the icosahedron. This is likely due to the Vertex Buffer Object implementation.
Please use the Icosahedron to get a full idea of what each generated texture looks like.
