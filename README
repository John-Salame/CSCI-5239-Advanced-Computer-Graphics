# Homework 2 - Procedural Textures
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
Approximately 7-8 hours.

### Description
Uses OpenGL 4 to create a scene.  

### Limitations
Currently I do not have everything I wanted. I originally had a sort of lawn made of many instances of grass. However, it only draws one.
I have lighting but no textures. I am not sure what I would put textures on.  
I also had fireflies that acted as small point lights when I was working on homework 3, but those fireflies are not fixed yet in GL4.
I could add them, but there is only a single blade of grass to illuminate.    
There is also a message "invalid value" in the VAO creator function for the blade of grass. I am not sure why.

## Interaction
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Press the nubmer 0 to re-center the object.  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.
