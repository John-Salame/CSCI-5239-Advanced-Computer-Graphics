# Homework 2 - Procedural Textures
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
Approximately 10 hours.

### Description
Uses OpenGL 4 to create a scene.  

## Changes
I changed the CSCI x239 library to have a "simple" icosahedron that I could use to place lights.
The simple Icosahedron does not have color or textures, simply vertex position.

### Limitations
The lighitng is not exactly correct. It is using the same normals that a cube would use, rather than the proper skew of the blade of grass.  
In homework 3, I had fireflies that acted as small point lights. I did not add those back in GL4.  
The icosahedron tracking the point light also stopped showing up for some reason. I am going through the code but I cannot determine why and do not want to spend more time debugging.

## Interaction
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Press the nubmer 0 to re-center the object.  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.


### Key bindings
  0          Reset the view
  p          Change projection mode
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  ] and [    Zoom in and out
  +/-        Make the blade of grass go closer/further to the origin (originally changed the number of blades of grass in the lawn, but the program is only drawing one blade)
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit
