# Homework 2 - Procedural Textures
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
Approximately 3 to 5 hours.

## Description
Demonstrates the optimization done by the shader compiler.

## Interaction
Press +/- to add / remove patches of grass. This affects the number of vertices and the load on the shaders.  
Press M to switch shaders and look at different generated textures.  
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Press numbers 1 through 4 to move the object to the corners of the screen.  
Press the nubmer 0 to re-center the object.  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.

### Difference in Performance
My first shader, firefly1.vert, checks if the square magnitude of the distance vector from a vertex to a firefly is within a threshold before applying lighting.
This uses an if statement.  
The second shader, firefly2.vert, does not have any if statement and simply relies on attenuation to reduce the lighting far away.  
I expected the first shader to have worse performance, but there does not seem to be any change in FPS at all between the shaders.  
There is also no change in FPS when switching to the fixed pipeline. I can conclude that the shader compiler has optimized firefly1.vert.  
One possible way the compiler could do this is to turn the if statement into a step function and then use the output of the step function in a mixer to add color when necessary.
