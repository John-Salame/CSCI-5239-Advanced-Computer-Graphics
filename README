# Advanced Computer Graphics HW 10 - Compute Shader
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
Final Project:
Part Related to Compute Shader (Boids) (6.5 hr total):
* 4 hr modifying my program to allow for swarms of fireflies to be created and contribute to lighting.
* 1 hr adding cohesion and steering toward average heading (it's too cohesive at this point, converges to uniform flock too quickly)
* 1.5 hr messing with the settings trying and failing to get a chaotic swarm. It is still very cohesive. Maybe it would require different equations.
* * I also added a bounding box of sorts to prevent the fireflies from flying off-screen. It gently pulls them toward (0, 1.5, 0).
* The swarm looks pretty lame. I will add some noise to the velocity at the very least. It should make the animation more interesting.
* Change aversion to 0 if you want something more exciting that looks more like typical Boids.


### Description
I attempted to make little particles that explode away from a firefly. I planned to have the particles periodically disappear and respawn but did not have time to implement that. The particles also do not follow the fireflies for some reason.


## Interaction
Press the number 0 to replay the particle effect with new initial values or reset the view of the scene.
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.  
Press +/- to add or remove patches of grass.  
Press PG UP / PG DOWN or the square brackets to zoom in or out.


### Key bindings
  0          Reset the view
  p          Change projection mode
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  ] and [    Zoom in and out
  +/-        Make the blade of grass go closer/further to the origin (originally changed the number of blades of grass in the lawn, but the program is only drawing one blade)
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit
