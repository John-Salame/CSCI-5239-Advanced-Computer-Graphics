# Homework 2 - Procedural Textures
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
Approximately  6 hours.

### Description
Uses OpenGL 4 to create a scene.  

### Limitations
Currently I do not have everything I wanted. I originally had a sort of lawn made of many instances of grass. However, it only draws one.
Perhaps it is drawing all of them on top of each other since my transform matrices are uniform variables.  
I also do not yet have lighting or textures. I am not sure what I would apply textures to.  
I also had fireflies that acted as small point lights when I was working on homework 3, but those fireflies are not fixed yet in GL4.  
There is also a message "invalid value" in the VAO creator function for the blade of grass. I am not sure why.

## Interaction
Press M to switch shaders and look at different generated textures.  
Press O to toggle between cube and icosahedron.  
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Press the nubmer 0 to re-center the object.  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.
