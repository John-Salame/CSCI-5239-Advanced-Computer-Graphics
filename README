# Homework 9 - Advanced Shaders (Compute Shader)
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
4 hours getting a runnable program.  
0.5 additional hours getting an incorrect program that meets the requirements.
* The little stars / sparks are centered around the origin instead of the fireflies. I think I fail to correctly set ParentVertex in the particle shader.

### Description
I attempted to make little particles that explode away from a firefly. I planned to have the particles periodically disappear and respawn but did not have time to implement that. The particles also do not follow the fireflies for some reason.


## Interaction
Press the number 0 to replay the particle effect with new initial values or reset the view of the scene.
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.  
Press +/- to add or remove patches of grass.  
Press PG UP / PG DOWN or the square brackets to zoom in or out.


### Key bindings
  0          Reset the view
  p          Change projection mode
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  ] and [    Zoom in and out
  +/-        Make the blade of grass go closer/further to the origin (originally changed the number of blades of grass in the lawn, but the program is only drawing one blade)
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit
