# Homework 6 - Image Processing

CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
7 hours.
I first tried to get it workin in OpenGL 4, then in OpenGL 2. In both cases, I was unable to get it to render. I got a black screen when trying to draw the quad from the framebuffer texture.
Issue may be with the viewport, projection, or Z-Buffer.

### Description
Use framebuffers and renderbuffers to draw a post-processed scene.

### Limitations
I still have not managed to debug the cause of the black screen. The text still shows up. I am not sure which line would render the framebuffer.

## Interaction
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Press the nubmer 0 to re-center the object.  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.


### Key bindings
  0          Reset the view
  I          Toggle image post-processing
  p          Change projection mode
  M          Change shader mode
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  ] and [    Zoom in and out
  +/-        Make the blade of grass go closer/further to the origin (originally changed the number of blades of grass in the lawn, but the program is only drawing one blade)
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit
