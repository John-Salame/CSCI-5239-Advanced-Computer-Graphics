# Homework 7 - Stored Textures
John Salame
CSCI 5239 Spring 2023

## Time taken
1 - 1.5 hours

### Description
Use noise to add randomization to the heights of the grass.
Previously I had done my randomization in the main function, but now it is done using the noise texture "grassHeights" in firefly1.vert.

### Limitations
I still have not managed to debug the cause of the black screen. The text still shows up. I am not sure which line would render the framebuffer.

## Interaction
Press P to toggle projection mode (orthogonal or perspective).  
Press the nubmer 0 to re-center the object.  
Use arrow keys to make the camera orbit the scene.  
Press +/- to add or remove patches of grass.  
Press PG UP / PG DOWN or the square brackets to zoom in or out.
